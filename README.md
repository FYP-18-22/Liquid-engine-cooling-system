## **Introduction and description**
The repository details the design and development of a liquid rocket engine cooling system. The project was developed to meet the goals of the [Nakuja Project](https://nakujaproject.com). The project begun by first design a liquid rocket engine with the following parameters:

> - Desired Thrust =  2 kN
> - Mass flowrate = 1.18703 kg/s
> - Fuel = Ethanol (99%)
> - Oxidizer = Gaseous Oxygen (GOX)
> - Oxizer/Fuel ratio = 1.6

The design of this engine is detailed in this repo. Thereafter a method of cooling was determined. Regenerative cooling was chosen. The coaxial shell implemenatation of regenerative cooling was chosen. The design of the overal system is as detailed in the repository.

## **Directory structure**
The repo is ordered as follows:

|-- [analysis](/analysis)

Contains files on the CFD analysis conducted on the proposed designs.

|--[calculations](/calculations)

Contains the CEA software as well the generated files used to generate the geometrey of the liquid rocket engine.

|-- [design files](/design%20files)

Contains the inventor drawings and assembly files of the various liquid engine designs. The files of the final implemented deisgn are [here](/design%20files/ethanol%20engine%206/Aluminium%20engine%20v2/).

|-- [reports](/reports)

Contains the interim and final reports of the project.

|--[resources](/resources)

Contains resources for the repository.

## **Software used**
1. Inventor - for all drawings
2. NASA CEA - for isentropic flow calculations
3. ANSYS Fluent - for all CFD analysis
